#### Extension Points
The extension points in this system are the methods defined in the GamePlugin interface that TicTacToePlugin implements. These methods provide a way to customize the behavior of the game.

#### Design Pattern
The design pattern used in this code is the Template Method pattern. The GamePlugin interface defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. TicTacToePlugin extends this algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. The methods in the GamePlugin interface are the "hooks" or "extension points" that can be implemented differently by any class that implements the interface.
